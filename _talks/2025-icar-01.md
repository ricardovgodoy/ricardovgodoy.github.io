Robotic platforms are playing an increasingly vital role in the inspection and maintenance of complex industrial assets. Equipped with mobile bases and a diverse suite of sensors, including vision, thermography, ultrasound, and vibration monitors, these systems can autonomously navigate large facilities, gather high-resolution data, and identify early-stage faults long before they escalate into costly failures. In several industries, robotic solutions have begun to demonstrate their value; however, different sectors face challenges in their deployment. Harsh environmental conditions, heterogeneous legacy equipment, stringent safety regulations, and the need for real-time decision support all hinder the seamless integration of autonomous inspection systems. Moreover, advanced data-fusion algorithms and AI-driven anomaly-detection methods, while promising in the lab, often struggle to scale reliably in the field without close industry feedback. 
This full‑day workshop will convene experts from industry and academia to survey current implementations, dissect technical and organizational bottlenecks, and chart a collaborative roadmap for robot‑centered failure detection. Through a combination of keynote talks, interactive presentations, panel discussions, and poster sessions, participants will leave with actionable insights into deploying mobile inspection robots, integrating advanced sensing modalities, and leveraging AI for predictive maintenance—laying the groundwork for new partnerships throughout Latin America and beyond.
