Various human machine interfaces (HMI) have been developed employing various control methods to suit the specific needs of the user. These interfaces can employ various types of biosignals to offer an intuitive and hands-free method of robotic control. However, biosignals require pre-processing and can vary depending on biological differences of the users, leading to differences between individuals as well as the same individual between recording sessions. The content covered in this proposed tutorial is based on a very recent work of the authors, where they developed semiautonomous and shared control schemes based on biological signals from the user. Additionally, the tutorial also covers the data collection procedure and data treatment steps in order to train machine learning models to decode these signals. Therefore, the tutorial will provide the participants with all the tools needed to perform data collection, model training and development, and implement control of HMI to perform a semiautonomous and shared control for the execution of complex manipulation tasks using robotic devices.
