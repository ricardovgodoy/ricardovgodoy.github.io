Advanced mechatronic principles and techniques for measuring and manipulating biological systems. Human biomechanics and motion control, advanced serial and parallel robots, compliant soft robots, software and functional safety, human robot interaction and force control, novel sensors and actuators, and biomechatronic design principles. Includes an individual project related to the analysis, selection and successful implementation of one of these advanced technologies.

Course Overview
======
Explores principles, methods, and techniques of Mechatronics for analyzing, modelling, designing, and controlling advanced bioinspired robotic systems and biomechatronic systems.

Topics include: 
- Introduction to Biomechatronics
- Biological Signals & Biosensors (e.g., EEG, EMG, ECG, Vision, Sound and haptic sensors etc.)
- Human Motion Analysis (e.g., gait kinematics and kinetics analysis)
- Bioinstrumentation (e.g., pneumatic muscles, IPMC, DEA, Hybrid actuators etc.)
- Human Robot Interaction (e.g., human-robot interaction modelling, antagonistic configurations, direct force control, impedance and assist-as-needed control etc.)
- Biomechatronic Example #1 (e.g., rehabilitation robots and assistive devices, design optimization, Integration of biosensors and actuators, interfacing issues etc.) 
- Biomechatronic Example #2 (e.g., biorobotic instrumentation, design and analysis of soft-bodied robotics).
