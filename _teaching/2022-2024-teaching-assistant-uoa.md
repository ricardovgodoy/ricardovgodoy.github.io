Mechatronic principles and techniques for measuring, assisting, augmenting, and mimicking biological systems. Topics include: brain machine interfaces, sensors and actuators, biomechanics and motion control, wearable and assistive devices, bioinstrumentation, soft robotic technologies, human factors, safety/ethical aspects, and biomechatronic design principles. Significant hands-on experience through the design, modelling, and development of paradigmatic biomechatronic systems.

Course Overview
======
Explores principles, methods, and techniques of Mechatronics for analyzing, modelling, designing, and controlling bioinspired robotic systems and biomechatronic systems. 

Topics include: 
- Introduction to Biomechatronics
- Biological Signals & Biosensors (e.g., EEG, EMG, ECG, Vision, Sound, and haptic sensors, etc.)
- Human Motion Analysis (e.g., gait kinematics and kinetics analysis)
- Bioinstrumentation (e.g., pneumatic muscles, IPMC, DEA, Hybrid actuators, etc.)
- Human Robot Interaction (e.g., human-robot interaction modelling, antagonistic configurations, direct force control, impedance and assist-as-needed control etc.)
- Biomechatronic Example #1 (e.g., rehabilitation robots and assistive devices, design optimization, Integration of biosensors and actuators, interfacing issues etc.)
- Biomechatronic Example #2 (e.g., biorobotic instrumentation, design, and analysis of soft-bodied robotics).
