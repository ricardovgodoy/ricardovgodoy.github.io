Welcome to my personal website.

My research is focused on advancing the fields of **robotics**, **machine learning**, and **human-machine interfaces**. 

My main research topics are:
- Dexterous robotic manipulation and teleoperation
- Biosignal decoding (e.g., EMG, LMG) for intent recognition
- Deep learning for processing multimodal sensor systems
- Real-time control frameworks for manipulators and legged robots

I work with platforms including Boston Dynamicsâ€™ Spot, robotic arms, and wearable sensor systems.  
I am passionate about solving real-world problems through engineering, experimentation, and collaborations.
