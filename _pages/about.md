I build **Physical AI** systems for real robots, focusing on **manipulation** and **locomanipulation** in cluttered environments, where sensing is imperfect, and control must be deployed in real-time, addressing real-world problems.

My work sits at the interface of:
- **Robot embodiment & manipulation** (arms, grippers, mobile platforms)
- **Human-in-the-loop control** (teleoperation, shared control, wearable sensing)
- **Robot autonomy on real tasks** (perception-to-action pipelines that works robustly and reliable)

### Current focus
- **Dexterous manipulation under uncertainty:** robust grasping and manipulation of unknown objects in clutter using **vision + proprioception**.
- **Intuitive robot control:** wearable sensing (e.g., **EMG/LMG**) + motion capture/vision to map human intent to robot actions, with shared-control layers for safety and task completion.
- **Mobile robotics:** mobile manipulation for inspection and maintenance tasks, where navigation and manipulation must run in the same loop.

I am passionate about solving real-world problems through engineering, experimentation, and collaborations.
