I teach engineering with a focus on **building systems that work**: sensing, estimation, control, and integration on real hardware.

I routinely use **active learning** (problem-based sessions, short group discussions around real-world cases, and structured lab work), while still employing expository lectures when a topic benefits from a clear derivation or a careful conceptual setup.

Below are the courses I have taught and supported.
