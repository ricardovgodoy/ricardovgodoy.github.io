% Mechatronic engineer and roboticist with experience in human-machine interfaces and artificial intelligence. Communicative and motivated engineer seeking to leverage my innovative skills through challenging opportunities.

%PhD candidate in Mechatronics Engineering at The University of Auckland. Research on machine learning and human-machine interfaces.

I am a robotics researcher focused on \textbf{Physical AI}, integrating learning-enabled robot capabilities into real-world \textbf{inspection}, \textbf{automation}, and \textbf{assistive} frameworks. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of São Paulo (USP), working on the development of robotic frameworks for inspection and automation, with an emphasis on \textbf{manipulation and loco-manipulation}. I received my PhD at the University of Auckland, where I developed \textbf{human–robot interfaces and shared-control} methods to combine \textbf{biosignals} (e.g., EMG) and \textbf{wearable devices} with external sensing (e.g., \textbf{motion capture and vision}) to decode discrete and continuous human motion for intuitive robot control. Previously, during my MSc at USP, I worked on \textbf{EEG-based machine learning for seizure prediction}. My primary interest lies in robotics, sensing, and learning, with the goal of developing systems that are \textbf{reliable on hardware and deployable in real settings} across \textbf{industrial, healthcare, and daily-life applications}.
