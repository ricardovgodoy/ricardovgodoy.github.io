% Mechatronic engineer and roboticist with experience in human-machine interfaces and artificial intelligence. Communicative and motivated engineer seeking to leverage my innovative skills through challenging opportunities.

%PhD candidate in Mechatronics Engineering at The University of Auckland. Research on machine learning and human-machine interfaces.

I am currently a postdoc at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, working with the Petrobras project towards the development of \textbf{robotic frameworks for inspection and automation}, focusing on \textbf{manipulation and loco-manipulation} frameworks. I got my PhD from The University of Auckland, New Zealand, where my research focused on the applications of advanced \textbf{machine learning techniques} for the development of \textbf{human-machine interfaces} to efficiently decode discrete and continuous \textbf{human motions} using biosignal-based interfaces and external sensors for implementing shared control frameworks. Before this, I was an MSc student at the University of São Paulo, and a member of the \textbf{robotic surgery group}, where my work focused on developing machine learning \textbf{frameworks for predicting epileptic seizures} using electroencephalography signals. My \textbf{main interest} is in employing machine learning techniques for \textbf{intuitive and robust control for applications in robotics, rehabilitation, inspection, and automation}.
