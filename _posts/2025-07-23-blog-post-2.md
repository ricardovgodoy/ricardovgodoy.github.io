Dear Researcher,

This call is for 03 (three) postdoctoral positions to join a two-year (renewable) research project sponsored by Petrobras at the University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos campus, Brazil, aiming to advance the use of mobile robots for autonomous inspection in refineries and oil platforms.

- About the Project

The project focuses on real-world applications of mobile robotics in challenging industrial environments. It encompasses multiple robotic platforms, including:
-Legged robots: Boston Dynamics Spot, ANYbotics ANYmal, Unitree B2
-Wheeled and hybrid robots: Taurob Inspector, Ascento
-Aerial robots: Flybotix ASIO
The research will address complex topics in autonomous navigation, motion and path planning, environmental perception, and reinforcement learning, aiming for robust, long-term autonomy in harsh and dynamic environments.

- Position Details

-Location: USP – São Carlos Campus, Brazil
-Duration: 2 years (renewable)
-Start Date: As soon as possible
-Salary: Competitive and well above average for the region’s cost of living

- Candidate Profile


We are seeking a motivated researcher with:
-A Ph.D. in Robotics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related field
-Strong publication record in top-tier robotics conferences or journals (e.g., ICRA, IROS, RSS, RA-L, T-RO)
-Experience in at least one of the following areas: Autonomous navigation, Motion/path planning. Reinforcement learning, Loco-manipulation for legged robots
-Hands-on experience with mobile robotic platforms is highly desirable
-Excellent programming skills (e.g., C++, Python, ROS)
